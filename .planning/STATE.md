# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-14)

**Core value:** AI assistants can safely read and modify structured configuration files without destroying formatting, comments, or file structure.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 complete — Competitive Features

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 4 (Competitive Features)
Plan: 2/2 complete
Status: Phase 04 complete
Last activity: 2026-02-15 — Plan 04-02 complete (OpenTelemetry optional extras and custom yq.execute spans)

Progress: [██████████] 100% (4 phases complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 12
- Average duration: 9min
- Total execution time: 110min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | -------- |
| 01    | 4     | 26min | 7min     |
| 02    | 4     | 48min | 12min    |
| 03    | 2     | 11min | 6min     |
| 04    | 2     | 25min | 13min    |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 02-04 (17min), 03-01 (7min), 03-02 (4min), 04-01 (18min), 04-02 (7min)
- Trend: Phase 4 complete -- telemetry plan faster due to smaller scope

_Updated after each plan completion_

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Research before building: Domain is evolving (FastMCP 3, dasel ecosystem) -- research completed 2026-02-14
- Keep existing tool names: Production clients depend on current API surface
- Evaluate yq alternatives: Research concluded dasel destroys comments/anchors -- staying with yq
- Parallel type definitions: base.py defines canonical types while yq_wrapper.py retains copies until Plan 03 shim conversion
- SAFE-01: ruamel.yaml pinned >=0.18.0,<0.19 to prevent zig-compiler deployment failures
- Re-export pattern: noqa:F401 for backward-compatible re-exports from services submodules
- FormatType import: formats/base.py imports from yq_wrapper (not backends.base) until Plan 01-03 unifies types
- \_parse_typed_json: internal to formats/base.py, not imported by server.py
- [Phase 01]: Shim re-export: yq_wrapper.py converts to backward-compatible facade over backends/ submodules
- [Phase 02]: ToolResponse base uses extra=allow as safety net during refactoring (tighten to forbid in Plan 04)
- [Phase 02]: SchemaInfo must be runtime import in responses.py (noqa: TC001) -- Pydantic requires field types at model building time
- [Phase 02]: ValueError used instead of orjson.JSONDecodeError in schema_validation.py (functionally equivalent, avoids unnecessary dependency)
- [Phase 02]: schema_manager passed as optional parameter (default None) to service-layer dispatch/handler functions instead of global access
- [Phase 02]: Re-export \_validate_and_write_content and is_schema from server.py for backward compat (noqa: F401)
- [Phase 02]: \_\_all\_\_ added to server.py for mypy explicit-export compliance (adds 40 lines but resolves 23 attr-defined errors)
- [Phase 02]: \_DictAccessMixin added to response models for backward-compatible dict-like access (tests use result['key'] patterns)
- [Phase 02]: Response model imports must be runtime (not TYPE_CHECKING) -- FastMCP/Pydantic resolves return type annotations at module load
- [Phase 02]: ConstraintValidateResponse uses extra='allow' for dynamic fields (suggestions, remaining_pattern)
- [Phase 02]: is_partial maps False->None in ConstraintValidateResponse for None-as-absent semantics in \_DictAccessMixin
- [Phase 03]: FastMCP 3.x decorators return original function directly; .fn accessor removed from all tests
- [Phase 03]: mask_error_details=False parameter still works in 3.x, no server.py changes needed
- [Phase 03]: ThreadPoolExecutor in schemas.py is for schema scanning, not MCP tool dispatch -- kept as-is
- [Phase 03]: 60s timeout for file-processing tools, 10s for in-memory tools
- [Phase 03]: Draft 2020-12 as default JSON Schema validator; Draft 7 only for explicit $schema with "draft-07"
- [Phase 03]: outputSchema auto-generated by FastMCP 3.x for all return types including dict[str, Any]
- [Phase 04]: DeepDiff verbose_level=2 for detailed old/new value reporting in diff output
- [Phase 04]: cast() alias pattern for mypy FunctionTool-not-callable when prek checks tool+test files together
- [Phase 04]: Import tool functions from server module in tests (not tools/) to avoid circular import through mcp object
- [Phase 04]: Monkeypatch get_tracer in tests instead of global TracerProvider (OTEL set_tracer_provider only works once per process)
- [Phase 04]: opentelemetry-api is transitive dep of FastMCP, only SDK and exporter in optional-dependencies

### Pending Todos

3 todos captured from code review (2026-02-15):

1. **Fix systemic code quality issues** (area: services) — dict returns, DRY violations, exception patterns, print logging
2. **Refactor god modules and deprecated shims** (area: services) — split data_operations.py/schemas.py, migrate yq_wrapper imports
3. **Improve test quality and coverage gaps** (area: testing) — private method tests, behavioral naming, edge case coverage

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.

**Research findings:**

- FastMCP 3.0.0rc2 installed and all 415 tests passing (Phase 4 complete)
- ruamel.yaml pinned <0.19 (SAFE-01 complete in Plan 01-01)
- Dasel comment/anchor destruction eliminates backend migration path (architectural constraint confirmed)
- deepdiff 8.6.1 installed with orderly-set dependency
- opentelemetry-sdk 1.39.1 as optional telemetry extra, API available as FastMCP transitive dep
